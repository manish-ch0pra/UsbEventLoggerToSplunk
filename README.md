# 🔌 USB Event Logger (Vibe Edition)

This is a simple C# console app that listens for USB insert/eject events and logs basic device info like the device name to Splunk. It was created purely for **vibing** and experimenting with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and event-driven architecture on Windows.

> 🚨 **Warning!** This code is just for fun! I’m literally just **playing around** and **vibing** with code.  
> It was generated with some help from **ChatGPT**, but it’s **not production-ready** in any way.  
> It’s a messy, exploratory project that’s just here to have fun with — so please **don’t use this in production**. 

If you want to explore how USB events work or mess around with some C# code, feel free to play with it, fork it, and vibe along. But keep in mind, it’s **just for the vibes**. 🎧💻

## What’s Going On?

- **Listening** for USB insertions and ejections 🧳
- **Logging** the device name (if available) 📸
- **Just vibing** with the tech ✌️

Feel free to mess around with the code, learn from it, and see how **WMI** and event-driven programming work on Windows. But again, **please don’t use this in any real-world, serious applications**.

Enjoy the vibe! ✨
