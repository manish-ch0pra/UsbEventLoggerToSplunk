🔌 USB Event Logger (Just Vibing Edition)
This is a lightweight C# console app that listens for USB insert/eject events on Windows and logs basic device info — mostly just the name. It was built for fun, experimenting with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and event-driven architecture.

Nothing too serious — just playing around, coding with vibes. 🧘‍♂️💻
